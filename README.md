# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
A cellular automation

Conway's game of life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a two-dimensional grid of cells with finite number of states - alive or dead. The state of cells changes with each generation according to specific rules. The rules consider the state of each cell in the last generation and these of its neighbours.
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by under population.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Interaction happens through creating the initial state and monitoring the evolution or creating patterns with particular properties(advanced).
